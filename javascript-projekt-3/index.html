            nodes: attaking (red), defending(blue) and gifting(yellow) and these
            can be seperated into more groups. Sword type is for attacking and
            defending and is the easiest difficulty, then there is the knight
            type same as the sword type, but more difficult, after there is the
            reinforcement type, which give bonuses to you, then there is the
            fortress type, which is as difficult as the knight type, but it
            gives bonuses to the boss type enemies, the most difficult type of
            them all.
